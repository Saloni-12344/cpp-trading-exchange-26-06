# cpp-trading-exchange

A high-performance trading exchange engine written in C++26.

The exchange implements core matching-engine components: order intake, a price-time-priority matching algorithm, and market-data dissemination — built with low-latency primitives (lock-free queues, memory pools, RDTSC timing).

## Quick start

```bash
bazel build //...   # build everything
bazel test //...    # run all tests
```

See [BAZEL_BUILD.md](BAZEL_BUILD.md) for full build instructions, available targets, and compiler flags.
